# HTML_CSS_JS
Exercise in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Intended for those who might be either learning these or would just like to have several examples in a single page.

Some might consider these relatively simple examples and they only reflect a way of how I am going about learning these languages.

A good portion of the page should be self-explanatory, some content is static, some animated and some is interactive.

# Usage
All it takes is to:

- Download a zip file of this project and extract it.
- Navigate to the `Files` folder and open `Exercise.html` in your Internet browser.
