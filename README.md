# HTML_CSS_JS
Exercise in HTML, CSS and JavaScript ([jQuery](https://jquery.com/download/) as well). Intended for those who either might be learning these or would just like to have several examples in a single page. There is definitely lots of rotation examples, so try not to get dizzy.

Some might consider these as relatively simple examples but they only reflect a way of how I am going about learning these languages. Some code was simply adopted and modified from original public sources.

A good portion of the page should be self-explanatory, some content is static, some animated and some is interactive.

It is using a mix of internal and inline CSS styling, which can always be changed, packed and moved to external styles.css file.

Some things might not be supported or work as expected on certain browsers. This was tested as working in the latest Firefox browser on Windows 10 computer and the page did also show properly in the TenFourFox browser on Power Macintosh with the following notes:
 - missing emojis support for old OS X can be compensated, to a degree, with [Symbola Font](https://dn-works.com/ufas/)
 - alignment entries of "float: inline-start" and "float: inline-end" don't work and need to be replaced with "float: left" and "float: right", which works for modern browsers as well and has now been standardized in this exercise
 - add-on providing support for [playing MP4 video](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tenfourfox/files/addons/mp4/1.3406/) in TenFourFox

It would be recommended that you also check [this project](https://github.com/GitHubDragonFly/WebProject) and look at all the files created by it, especially because it is interacting with the django built-in server (there is also a link to django tutorial).

## Notes:
 - Adding more information to inline frame (iFrame) - you can get instructions for obtaining info about your browser and your public IP by visiting [WhatIsMyBrowser](https://www.whatismybrowser.com/developers/tools/iframe) page.
 - "3D Cube 1" drawing code might eventually need some corrections. Currently, the transparency allows it to be seen as correct but if you go about changing the "fill" and "stroke" values to more solid, 0.1 changed to 1.0, then you might see somewhat incorrect transitions. This is even more obvious if painting each side of the cube with a different color.
