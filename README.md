# HTML_CSS_JS
Exercise in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Intended for those who might be either learning these or would just like to have several examples in a single page.

Some might consider these as relatively simple examples but they only reflect a way of how I am going about learning these languages.

A good portion of the page should be self-explanatory, some content is static, some animated and some is interactive.

It is using a mix of internal and inline CSS styling, which can always be changed, packed and moved to external styles.css file.

It would be recommended that you also check [this](https://github.com/GitHubDragonFly/WebProject) project and look at all the files created by it, especially because it is interacting with the django built-in server (there is also a link to django tutorial).

# Usage
All it takes is to:

- Download a zip file of this project and extract it.
- Navigate to the `Files` folder and open `Exercise.html` in your Internet browser.
