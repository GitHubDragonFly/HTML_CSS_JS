# Create your own OBJ / PLY files from an image

The following websites can be used for file conversion:

 - https://convertio.co/png-dds/	(PNG to DDS)
 - https://imagetostl.com/	(PNG to STL)
 - https://anyconv.com/	(STL to OBJ)
 - https://www.meshconvert.com/ (OBJ to PLY)

Then either the three.js editor or free Blender app can be used to manipulate the files further:
